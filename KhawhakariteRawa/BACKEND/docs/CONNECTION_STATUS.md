# 🔗 Connection Status - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issues Found & Fixed:**

### **1. Backend Server was NOT Running**
- **Problem:** Port 8000 was not listening
- **Solution:** ✅ Started Python FastAPI backend server

### **2. Wrong Backend Proxy Configuration**

- **Solution:** ✅ Corrected proxy + restarted React server
- **Status:** ✅ **CONNECTED** - API calls should work now
